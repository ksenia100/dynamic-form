# Dynamic Form Builder

This project is a dynamic form builder implemented using Vue 3. It allows users to create forms with text input fields and provides features for dynamic field management, vowel count display, and search functionality.

## Features

### Form Layout and Initial Setup

- The form displays three text input fields arranged in a single column.

### Dynamic Field Management

- Users can add additional input fields with a maximum limit of 10 fields.
- Each input field has an adjacent button to remove that specific field.
- At least one field remains on the form at all times.

### Vowel Count Display

- Next to each input field, the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) entered in that field is displayed.

### Search Functionality

- A text search field is located at the top of the form.
- Input fields containing the text entered in the search field are highlighted with a green background.
- If the search text matches any text in the input fields, the search field is also highlighted with a green background.
